First, you will need any IDE that can run Python code. Create a new project and install "Tesseract" package. It is used to get data from images.

Download code and add it to your project. Also add downloaded earlier Tesseract in the same folder as main.py

Create your bot using Discord Developer Portal. Get your Discord Bot Token and put it in .csv file.
